# avm

Appium version manager, no subshells, no profile setup, no convoluted api, just _simple_.

## Installation

    $ npm install -g appium-version-manager-1.5

or

    $ make install

to `$HOME`. Prefix later calls to `avm` with `PREFIX=$HOME`

    $ PREFIX=$HOME make install

### Installing Binaries

Install a few appium versions:

    $ avm latest
    $ avm 1.5.0
    $ avm 1.6.5

Type `avm` to prompt selection of an installed appium. Use the up /
down arrow to navigate, and press enter or the right arrow to
select, or ^C to cancel:

    $ avm

      1.5.0
    Î¿ 1.6.4
      1.6.5

Use or install the latest official release:

    $ avm latest

Switch to the previous version you were using:

    $ avm prev

### Removing Versions

Remove some versions:

    $ avm rm 1.5.0 1.6.4

Instead of using `rm` we can simply use `-`:

    $ avm - 1.6.4

### Appium Usage

When running multiple versions of appium, we can target
them directly by asking `avm` for the binary path:

    $ avm bin 1.6.5
    /usr/local/avm/versions/1.6.5/node_modules/appium/bin/appium.js

Or by using a specific version through `avm`'s `use` sub-command:

    $ avm use 1.6.5 -p 4723 -U c9ccb3bs43ef70cb0d79a113c21a6b4bbee03e28 --app com.app.bundle.id

## Details

 `avm` by default installs appium to _/usr/local/avm/versions_, from
 which it can see what you have currently installed, and activate previously 
 installed versions of appium when `avm <version>` is invoked again.

 Activated appium binary is then installed by symlinking to _/usr/local/bin/appium_.

 To alter where `avm` operates simply export __AVM_PREFIX__ to whatever you prefer.
 It defaults to _/usr/local_
